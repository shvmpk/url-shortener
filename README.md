# 🚀 Industry-Level URL Shortener

An advanced, production-grade URL shortening service built for internet-scale systems. Designed with scalability, observability, and extensibility in mind — yet still under active development with new features being added regularly.

## 📌 What is a URL Shortener?

A **URL shortener** transforms long URLs into short, manageable links that are easier to share and track. For example:

```
Original: https://example.com/urls/www.google.com/about/ndksnadkdasd..  
Shortened: https://yourshorturl.com/xYz1K8
```

When the short URL is accessed, the service **redirects** the user to the original long URL — possibly validating, tracking, and applying security or expiration rules in between.

## ⚙️ Scale Requirements

This URL shortener is built with large-scale production usage in mind:

* 🔥 **100M Daily Active Users**
* 📈 **Read\:Write ratio** of **100:1**
* 🧠 **Data retention**: 5 years
* 🧲 **1M write requests/day**
* 📊 Optimized for heavy **read traffic** and long-term analytics

## 🧠 Design Decisions & Architecture

### 🔢 Unique ID Generation

To ensure **distributed-safe short codes**, the system uses:

* ❄️ **Snowflake IDs** (timestamp + machine ID)
* Encoded via **Base62** (A–Z, a–z, 0–9) for shorter, URL-friendly codes
* ❌ Avoided manually configured machine IDs via `application.yml` to reduce human error

### ↺ Caching Strategy

* Uses a **multi-layered approach**:

    * **Bloom Filter** (existence check)
    * **Redis** (hot read/write cache)
    * **PostgreSQL** (source of truth)

> ⚠️ In future iterations, we can replace PostgreSQL with **Cassandra** or **DynamoDB** for true horizontal scalability.
